# Horiseon Social Solutions Campaign

## Description

This project was to solidify the lessons learned in Module one of the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This project taught me to change non-descript elements of the HTML file into what are called 'semantic' elements. This give a better description to different parts of the webpage to improve both SEO (search engine optimization) as well as accessability. I also learned setting up repositories from files in other repositories as well as improving my README file creation skills.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This webpage is intended for practicing our HTML organization and notation skills. You can explore the page in the inspect tab in a browser and see that there are no '<div>' elements present. Below is a screen shot from the class repository for the sake of comparison. This finished project should look similar to the linked screenshot.
